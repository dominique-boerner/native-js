# native-js
###### A plain JavaScript approach for creating applications

## Overview

This project explores the feasibility of developing complex applications using plain JavaScript, without the reliance on
modern frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue. The aim is to understand the capabilities and limitations of native
JavaScript and to demonstrate how sophisticated applications can be built from scratch using just vanilla JS.

> For a better development Workflow, this project uses "Vite". For the experimentation, this is fine, because its only
> used on build-time and does not affect the app itself.

## Project Goals

**Evaluate Feasibility:** Determine if complex applications can be effectively developed using only native JavaScript.
**Understand Limitations:** Identify the challenges and limitations of not using frameworks.
**Provide Examples:** Create detailed examples and case studies of different components and applications.
**Educational Purpose:** Serve as a learning resource for developers who want to deepen their understanding of native
JavaScript.

## Structure

The project is divided into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of a typical web application:

components/: Custom web components built using the Web Components API.
modules/: Separation of concerns via modules.

## Getting started

Run following commands:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
